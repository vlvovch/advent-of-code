My C++ solutions to various problems of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).
Uses lots of STL and sometimes shortcuts.
Newer editions are more readable.

### Usage:
```bash
cd 2023

# problem 1a
g++ day1a.cpp -o day1a
./day1a < day1.txt

# problem 1b
g++ day1b.cpp -o day1b
./day1b < day1.txt

# problem 2a
g++ day2a.cpp -o day2a
./day2a < day2.txt

# problem 2b
g++ day2b.cpp -o day2b
./day2b < day2.txt

...
```
